# Data-cleaning-in-STATA
Here, I prepared a survey dataset for analysis by labelling missing values, dropping incomplete observations, creating new variables from existing ones etc. Also created charts and graphs for data visualization

Description of the dataset: The dataset contains responses from a reserach survey to assess how South East Asians in Bexar County perceive the covid-19 vaccine and booster shot. 

Data Analaysis plan: To analyze what how vaccine status, virus perception vaccine perception, and source of health information differed by gender, age and education level 
Cont'd: Initial plan was to perform tests of ANOVA to see if responses differed between groups, and then a logistic regression to see details on how the groups differed. 
I could not follow through with this because there were no significant ANOVA test results and sample size was low. Thus, we settled for frequency statistics on the repsonses  

Final results: 
There was a borderline significant difference in booster status by gender of the participants. Females were more likely to be boosted than their male counterparts. (p= 0.045)
When asked for where most of the covid-related information came from, the younger group (aged 18-30) tended to utilize social media while participants within the age groups 51-70 preferred multiple information sources
